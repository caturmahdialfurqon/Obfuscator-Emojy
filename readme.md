# 🐍 Obfuscate Your Python Source Code with Emojy 😬 🤯  😬 🤫  🤣 😂

📰 Emojis and emoticons will be used in this script to obfuscate your Python source code. However, please note that I cannot guarantee the security of your source code once this process is complete. 

## Update and Upgrade With Python 3
  - at sat 26 oct 2024
    
Since the previous script hasn't worked on Python 3 for four years and I've encrypted its source code, I'm ashamed that I pinned this repository without updating it. I'd like to update it with open source code and make it more user-friendly.

## How To Use
- Clone this Repo
- Go to Folder
```bash
cd Update-CODE-Python3
```
- Install reqruirements.txt with pip (venv)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or 

- Install reqruirements.txt with Python3
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- python flymoji.py / python3 flymoji.py

## Old readme.md
- For this version of Python 2, I absolutely dislike scripting tools that used Argparse because it appears so time-consuming and complicated. However, old posts create memories, which is why I keep them up. Hehe.
